# HTML5

Hi there! Welcome to onapply technical test! :sunglasses:

Our goal today is going to improve a form using HTML5 features.
Ready? Let's get started.

First of all download the [zip file here](https://github.com/onapply/developer-tests/archive/master.zip). You will be working on these files on your computer locally. Feel free to use any editor of your choice.
Just a few recommendations depending on your current operating system:
- Windows: [notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.9.2.html)
- MacOS: [textmate](https://macromates.com/)
- Linux: gedit (sudo apt-get install gedit)

Once done unzip the file in your home directory and open the 3 files ([index.html](), styles.css, form.js)
##Task 1: multiple files
It's currently not possible to upload more than one file on the "references" and "portfolio" file inputs.
Use HTML5 to allow users to upload multiple files only on the "references" and "portfolio" file inputs.

##Task 2
When the page loads the init function in the form.js is called.
Write the function $p.calculateFileSize in HTML5 which will calculate the file size of all uploaded files.

##Task3
If the sum of all attached file is greater than 8MB the user should not be able to submit the form.

##Task4
Notify the user that the maximum allowed size has been reached
