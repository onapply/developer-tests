##Introduction
Our goal today is going to improve a form using HTML5 features.

First of all download the [zip file here](https://github.com/onapply/developer-tests/archive/master.zip).<br>
You will be working on these files on your computer locally. Feel free to use any editor of your choice.

Just a few recommendations depending on your current operating system:
- Windows: [notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.9.2.html)
- MacOS: [textmate](https://macromates.com/)
- Linux: gedit (sudo apt-get install gedit)

Please use a browser which supports HTML5 file management (latest version of Firefox/Chrome should do it)

You are not allowed to use any third party libraries which already have all features available.

Once set up, unzip the file in your home directory and open the 3 files ([index.html](https://github.com/onapply/developer-tests/blob/master/html5-file/index.html), [styles.css](https://github.com/onapply/developer-tests/blob/master/html5-file/styles.css), [form.js](https://github.com/onapply/developer-tests/blob/master/html5-file/form.js))


Ready?<br>
Let's get started!

##Task 1: allow form to submit files
It is currently not possible to submit files. Add the code to allow the form to submit files.

##Task 2: allow multiple files
It is currently not possible to upload more than one file on the "references" and "portfolio" file inputs.

Use HTML5 to allow users to upload multiple files only on the "references" and "portfolio" file inputs.

##Task 3: calculate file size
Once the page has been loaded the init function in the form.js is called.

Write the function $p.calculateFileSize in HTML5 which will calculate the file size of all attached files (before submitting the form)

##Task 4: 8MB maximum
If the sum of all attached file is greater than 8MB the user should not be able to submit the form.

##Task 5: notify user
Notify the user that the maximum allowed size has been reached

##Task 6: list files
Use HTML 5 to allow users to see a list of files they attached to each file input.

The List should display the **names**, **sizes** and **mime types** of each attached files.

##Task 7: drag and drop
Use HTML 5 to allow users to drag and drop files to all file inputs.

##how to submit your assessment
When the time allowed is over please send a zip files containing all 3 files to developer-assessments@onapply.de.

Don't forget to specify your first and last name in the email!

Hope you had fun!
Happy coding :beers:
